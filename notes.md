Notes:

- class experience with Logistic Regression and ANNs 
- background is mostly math and stats, not computational 
- don't rely on Python or coding knowledge; do exercises as live demos 
- focus on feature analysis and hyperparameter tuning 
- visual analysis with YB a big help! 
- for distributed computing, focus on high level computing issues, not mechanisms 
- no need for a cluster or workshops on the distributed computing day


Other Notes:

- Classification Metrics II to follow (ROC/AUC, DecisionThreshold, PR Curves, Class Balance issues)
