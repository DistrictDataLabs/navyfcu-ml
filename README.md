# Generalized Machine Learning

This repository contains notebooks, data, and slides for the survey of generalized machine learning and distributed computing training from September 14, 2018 - September 28, 2018. During this three day course, we will cover the following topics:

Day One:

- ML Review: Generalized ML and Spatial Learning, Bias/Variance Tradeoff, Model Selection Triple 
- Regularized Regression: LASSO vs Ridge; ElasticNet and more 
- Clustering: Partitive vs Agglomerative Clustering; clustering evaluation methods, visualization 
- Classification I: Instance and Inductive Models (kNN, Decision Trees, Ensembles of Trees)

Day 2:

- Classification II: Parametric Models: SVMs, Bayesian Models, Logistic Regression 
- Dimensionality Reduction and Manifolds: PCA, SVD, tSNE, Isomaps 
- Neural Networks I: Multi-Layer Perceptrons 
- Neural Networks II: Deep Learning and Tensorflow 

Day 3:

- Introduction to Spark: RDDs and Architecture  
- Programming Spark - interactive analysis and distributed jobs 
- Using Spark for data analysis: Spark SQL and Spark DataFrames 
- Spark for distributed ML: Spark MLlib 



Notes:

- class experience with Logistic Regression and ANNs 
- background is mostly math and stats, not computational 
- don't rely on Python or coding knowledge; do exercises as live demos 
- focus on feature analysis and hyperparameter tuning 
- visual analysis with YB a big help! 
- for distributed computing, focus on high level computing issues, not mechanisms 
- no need for a cluster or workshops on the distributed computing day


Other Notes:

- Classification Metrics II to follow (ROC/AUC, DecisionThreshold, PR Curves, Class Balance issues)
